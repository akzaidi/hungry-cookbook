\hypertarget{ingredients-1}{%
\subsection{ingredients}\label{ingredients-1}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  6 whole Scotch bonnet peppers (see note)
\item
  6 scallions, roughly chopped
\item
  1 (2-inch) knob fresh ginger, roughly chopped
\item
  6 garlic cloves
\item
  2 tablespoons freshly picked thyme leaves
\item
  1 tablespoon ground allspice
\item
  1 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg
\item
  2 tablespoons dark brown sugar
\item
  1/2 cup soy sauce
\item
  2 tablespoons zest and 1/4 cup juice from about 4 limes
\item
  1/4 cup olive oil
\item
  Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
\item
  1 large whole chicken, back removed, split in half along breastbone (4 to 4 1/2 pounds, see note)
\item
  1/4 cup whole allspice berries
\item
  3 dozen dried bay leaves (about 2 loosely packed cups)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{directions}{%
\subsection{Directions}\label{directions}}

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\item
  Combine peppers, scallions, ginger, garlic, thyme, allspice, nutmeg, brown sugar, soy sauce, lime zest and juice, olive oil, 2 teaspoons black pepper, and 1 tablespoon kosher salt in the work bowl of a food processor or the jar of a blender. Blend until a rough purée is formed, about 1 minute.
\item
  Place chickens in a large bowl or baking dish. Pour marinade over chickens and turn until thoroughly coated. Divide chicken and marinade between two gallon-sized zipper-lock bags, or place in a large baking dish and cover tightly with plastic wrap. Place whole allspice berries and bay leaves in a gallon-sized zipper-lock bag and fill with water. Refrigerate chicken and bay leaves at least 10 hours and up to 1 day.
\item
  When ready to cook, remove chicken from bags, allow excess marinade to drip off, and transfer to a large plate. Light one half chimney full of charcoal. When all the charcoal is lit and covered with gray ash, pour out and pile the coals against one wall of a kettle grill. Alternatively, set the leftmost burners of a gas grill to medium-high heat. Set cooking grate in place, cover grill and allow to preheat for 5 minutes. Clean and oil the grilling grate. Set bottom and lid vents to half open.
\item
  Drain bay leaves and allspice berries in a fine mesh strainer. Spread 2/3rds of bay leaves evenly over the cooler side of the grill (it's ok if some allspice berries fall through) in a pattern just large enough to fit the chickens. Lay the chickens over the bay leaves skin side up with the legs pointed towards the hotter side of the grill. Place 1/3 of remaining bay leaves over hot side of grill and immediately cover, with the vent above the chicken. Cook for 15 minutes.
\item
  Open lid and place half of remaining bay leaves and allspice berries on hot side of grill directly above the coals. Immediately cover and cook for another 15 minutes. Open lid, add 15 new coals to the pile of hot coals, then place remaining bay leaves and allspice berries on hot side of grill directly above the coals. Cover and continue to cook until the coolest part of the chicken breast registers 145°F on an instant read thermometer, about 20 minutes longer.
\item
  Uncover grill and wait five minutes until coals are hot again (if using gas grill, increase heat to high). Carefully lift the chicken off the bay leaves and transfer it to the hot side of the grill skin side up. Using tongs, drop the bay leaves into the grill directly onto the coals or burners so that they smoke. Cook the chicken until lightly charred, about 3 minutes. Flip chicken and continue to cook until skin is crisp and charred and coolest part of breast registers 150 to 155°F on an instant read thermometer, 4 to 6 minutes longer. Transfer to a large platter, allow to rest 5 minutes, and serve.

\subsection{Recipe}\label{recipe}}

Toast the cumin seeds on a skillet over medium heat, stirring constantly, until they start to pop and smell fragrant. Immediately transfer to a stone-mortar or spice-grinder before they burn. Grind them into a consistency that resembles coarsely ground black pepper, then set aside.

TO PREPARE THE LAMB AND SEASONINGS: Scatter lamb-slices flat on a chopping board in 1 single layer, then ``tap'' them all over with a sharp knife, aiming at scoring/tenderizing the meat without cutting through. Do this thoroughly. It allows the marinate to penetrate, and gives the lamb a more interesting texture. Then mix the lamb with the ``marinates'', using your hands to really distribute the seasonings evenly. Let marinate for at least 2 hours.

In 4 separate bowls, combine all the ingredients in each individual ``Seasoning A'', ``Seasoning B'', ``Seasoning C'' and ``Seasoning D''. Set aside.

TO MAKE THE HAND-SMASHED NOODLE: In a stand-mixer bowl (or with a hand-held mixer if it comes with dough-hooks)(hand-kneading not recommended), add Chinese dumpling flour, salt and water. Start mixing on low then gradually increase the speed to high, and knead for 5 \textasciitilde{} 6 min. The dough will feel shaggy and a bit dry in the beginning, but as the flour absorbs water and glutens start to form, it will become extremely smooth and elastic at the end. It will be sticky but pulls away cleanly from the bowl during mixing. You should be able to ``tap'' the dough quickly with your finger without it sticking, and pull it slowly upward into 12″ (30 cm) long without breaking. If the dough breaks, either it's not kneaded sufficiently or it's too dry. You'll have to try both ways (try kneading it for another 3 min first, before adding more water) to get it to the correct consistency. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and let rest for at least 1 hour.

Line a large baking sheet with parchment, set aside. Prepare a small cup of canola oil within your reach. Oil your hands well, then transfer the dough onto an oiled surface. Roll out into an approximately 1/2″ (1 cm) thick, rectangular shape, then cut into 10 long strips. Separate and lightly oil each strips so they don't stick back to each other. Take 1 strip and lay flat on the counter, then with oiled palm, start smashing/pounding the strip outward into a long, wide and flat noodle. Don't worry about evenness or straight edges because it doesn't matter. Now pick up the noodle on both ends, lift it and gently tap it on the counter while stretching it out slightly. You don't have to try hard. The noodle WANTS to stretch out and gravity will pretty much do the job for you! Lay the noodle flat, without any foldings, on the parchment-lined baking-sheet. Repeat with the rest (lay a new parchment over the top once you run out of space).

Carefully not to make the noodles too thin or they will lose their desired texture (you shouldn't be able to see through it).

TO COOK: Bring a large pot of water to boil. Meanwhile, heat another large deep skillet/wok over high heat. Mix 2 tbsp of canola oil (not in the ingredient list) into the marinated lamb to lubricate/separate them, then add to the hot skillet as spread out as possible. Let caramelize for 30 sec without moving, then start sautéing just until they are no longer pink. Add ``Seasoning A'' and cook just until it starts to soften, then transfer to a bowl.

Add 4 tbsp of canola oil from ``Seasoning B'' to the same skillet until hot, then add the rest of ``Seasoning B''. Cook until fragrant without burning the garlic, then add ``Seasoning C''. Turn off the heat while you cook the noodle. Add the noodles, one by one, into the boiling water. Cook just until they float to the surface (it will take less than a min), then drain/transfer to the skillet. Turn the skillet heat back on high, then add the lambs/onion and gently toss everything together. Finish with ``Seasoning D''.

Serve immediately with chili oil, and I'd like to sprinkle a bit more ground cumin on top.
